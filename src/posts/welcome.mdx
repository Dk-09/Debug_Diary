# Prerequisites
If you're a beginner, go learn `C` or something.  
You're back already? Fine. Go read the basics of the following, or ask your AI waifu ChatGPT to explain them to you in a cute voice:

1. Windows API
2. Windows Datatype
3. pointers - come back when you can read `char *(*(*fptr[3])())();`
4. PE structure
5. DLL (Don't Laugh Looser)
6. Payloads, Loaders, Shellcode & Execution Flow

### Shellcode
Shellcode isnâ€™t someone like _you_ â€” let's understand what it actually is.
![your internet sucks image not loaded](/images/welcome-1.png)
shellcode is **not dependent** on external address or header files as it's not compiled like an typical c/cpp language.

we will be using the following command to generate shellcode via [msfvenom](https://www.offsec.com/metasploit-unleashed/msfvenom/) 
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/exec CMD=clac.exe -f c

output - "0xFC 0x48..0x00"
```
Yeah â€” we'll be spawning _Calculator_ with shellcode for the first few examples.

### X64dbg
x64dbg is a tool that can help you find see how your program works behind the scene on the computer. Great for understanding execution flow, breaking stuff, and fixing errors.

1. How to open it: just double-click, genius
2. Attach an process - Alt + A to bring the attach window
3. Select the process that you want to attach and double click it

# Payload Injection
Payload injection is a technique to embed malicious code into a process. ideally without triggering AV. Usually, itâ€™s injected into legit processes like `notepad.exe`, `browser.exe`, `yourmomthick.exe`, etc.

Here is an basic intro for sextions in PE file 
1. .DATA - stores the global and static variables
2. .RDATA - stores the read only data that can't be changed during runtime. ex - const initialized data
3. .TEXT - stores the logic or code of the whole program
4. .RSRC - stores resource like image, icon etc.

## .DATA section
Now we will write an `C` program in **VS studio 2022** (recommended) to inject shellcode into our own `.data` section, then debug using *x64dbg*

```c
#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>

unsigned char buffer[]=
"\xfc\x48\x83\xe4\xf0\xe8\xc0\x00\x00\x00\x41\x51\x41\x50"
// I am not ging your the whole shellcode generate it yourself lazy ass
"\xd5\x63\x61\x6c\x63\x2e\x65\x78\x65\x00";

int main() {
	printf("[+] Location - %p", &buffer);
	getch(); // press anykey to end the program
	return 0;
}
```

1. Run the program and copy the printed address
2. In x64dbg, press `CTRL + G` and paste that address
3. Your brain should now connect the dots â€” the shellcode is stored at that location and visible in the top-right variable view

## .RDATA section
`.rdata` is for data that can't be modified at runtime, so we must use `const` for the payload.

```c
#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>

const unsigned char buffer[]=
"\xfc\x48\x83\xe4\xf0\xe8\xc0\x00\x00\x00\x41\x51\x41\x50"
// I am not ging your the whole shellcode generate it yourself lazy ass
"\xd5\x63\x61\x6c\x63\x2e\x65\x78\x65\x00";

int main() {
	printf("[+] Location - %p", &buffer);
	getch(); // press anykey to end the program
	return 0;
}
```

*Now now don't be lazy and do the debugging your self.*

## .TEXT section
This is where the actual code lives. But itâ€™s tricky â€” you canâ€™t just store data here easily, and thereâ€™s usually not much spare space. Not the best choice for payloads, but still possible: 

```c
#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#pragma section(".text") // used to change permission of section 

//we are using .text section to store the variable buffer
__declspec(allocate(".text")) const unsigned char buffer[]=
"\xfc\x48\x83\xe4\xf0\xe8\xc0\x00\x00\x00\x41\x51\x41\x50"
// I am not ging your the whole shellcode generate it yourself lazy ass
"\xd5\x63\x61\x6c\x63\x2e\x65\x78\x65\x00";

int main() {
	printf("[+] Location - %p", &buffer);
	getch(); // press anykey to end the program
	return 0;
}
```

*Now now don't be lazy and do the debugging your self.*

## .RSRC section
`.rsrc` section contain all the resources of the files like icons, wave files etc. This is the perfect place to hide an payload and also an bit lengthy one.

I'll be using vs studio to do this you can do it by MinGW also. Follow the following step 

- First make an file `payload.bin` and put shellcode in there (hope u remember what's *shellcode*)
- Add a **resource file** like shown below. youâ€™ll need to do this **twice** (first time it creates `resource.h` and `<project>.rc`)

![your internet sucks image not loaded](/images/welcome-4.png)

- Now it will allow you to import that payload, just first select any of the options menu, icon etc and then click import and import the `payload.bin` file

![your internet sucks image not loaded](/images/welcome-5.png)

- this is the final step where you have to specify what type of data does the file hold, we will type RCDATA which mean raw binary 

![your internet sucks image not loaded](/images/welcome-6.png)

- There is this `resources.h` file, have a look at it. it maps all the resources in the project and assigns a number to them which will be useful when we want to access the resource 

Now to actually _access_ that payload, we need to use some WinAPI magic:
- `FindResourceW`
- `LoadResource`
- `LockResource`
- `SizeofResource`

Go read about them on MSDN â€” write your own code if youâ€™re serious. But if you get stuck maybe i as your stepbrother will come to save you

```c
#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include "resource.h"

void RsrcSectionPayload() {
	HRSRC HandleForResource;
	HGLOBAL RetrieveHandle;
	LPVOID AddressOfResource;
	DWORD size;
	LPVOID TempBuffer;

	HandleForResource = FindResourceW(NULL,MAKEINTRESOURCE(IDR_RCDATA1), RT_RCDATA);
	RetrieveHandle = LoadResource(NULL, HandleForResource);
	AddressOfResource = LockResource(RetrieveHandle);
	size = SizeofResource(NULL, HandleForResource);

	printf("Address of Resource = %p\n", AddressOfResource);
	TempBuffer = malloc(size);
	memcpy(TempBuffer, AddressOfResource, size);
	printf("\nAddress of Resource in the Buffer = %p", TempBuffer);
	getch();
}
```

*Now now don't be lazy and do the debugging your self.*

## Final Words

Yeah yeah, I know your brain hurts â€” mine did too while writing this.  
See you next time with more malware dev chaos. ðŸ’€
