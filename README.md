# 🐞 Debug Diary

> _Reverse engineering my own sanity, one breakpoint at a time._

Welcome to **Debug Diary** — a raw, unfiltered logbook of my journey into reverse engineering, malware development, shellcode injection, and all things that live in the deep, dark memory of your OS.

This isn’t your happy-go-lucky JavaScript blog.  
This is the place where `x64dbg`, PE files, and cursed memory addresses roam free.

## 🧠 What Is This?

**Debug Diary** is a personal, hands-on learning series where I document:
- 🧩 Experiments with PE file structure
- 🧠 Understanding the Windows API & internal memory management
- 🐚 Building and injecting shellcode
- 🧵 Thread hijacking, process injection, and DLL stuff
- 🔍 Debugging using tools like `x64dbg`, Process Hacker, etc.
- 🧨 Bypassing modern defenses (AV, EDR, etc.)... eventually

This is **not a guide for beginners** — it's a messy, honest, WIP-style log made by someone who’s still learning but refuses to quit.

## 🧷 Why I Made This

Because I’m tired of tutorials that either:
1. Skip all the dirty work,
2. Explain things like you’re 5,
3. Or leave out the part where you *sit in x64dbg for 40 minutes wondering if the address is even real*.

I wanted a place to:
- Dump my experiments
- Document bugs and breakthroughs
- Laugh at my past self
- Help other people going through the same hell
